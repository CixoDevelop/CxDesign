# CxDesign

This project is a collection of elements thanks to which you can assemble your 
own custom furniture elements, such as shelf mounting brackets, shelf 
connectors, wardrobe legs, monitor mounts, and the like. Some of the elements 
are three-dimensional objects, these need to be printed on a 3D printer. You 
can modify the parameters to make the printing speed reasonable, in many cases 
even a 1 mm nozzle will be suitable for such a task. Other elements are flat. 
They have their own DXF drawings, so that they can be cut with a laser or 
similar methods in a flat sheet of plywood or plastic, and they also have their
versions in the form of 3D objects, so that they can also be printed. In most 
cases, however, it is better to cut out drawings of 2D objects rather than 
print them, this will ensure better durability.
